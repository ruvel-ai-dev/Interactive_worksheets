Sample Educational Worksheet: The Water Cycle

Introduction:
The water cycle is a continuous process that moves water throughout Earth's atmosphere, land, and oceans. Understanding this cycle is crucial for comprehending weather patterns and environmental science.

Key Concepts:

1. Evaporation
Water from oceans, rivers, and lakes turns into water vapor when heated by the sun. This process is called evaporation. The water vapor rises into the atmosphere.

2. Condensation
As water vapor rises higher in the atmosphere, it cools down and transforms back into tiny water droplets. This process is called condensation. These droplets form clouds.

3. Precipitation
When water droplets in clouds become too heavy, they fall back to Earth as precipitation. This can be in the form of rain, snow, sleet, or hail.

4. Collection
The precipitated water collects in various places such as oceans, rivers, lakes, and underground aquifers. From here, the cycle begins again.

Important Facts:
- The sun is the primary energy source that drives the water cycle
- About 97% of Earth's water is in the oceans
- Only 3% is freshwater, and most of that is frozen in ice caps and glaciers
- The water cycle has been operating for billions of years

Review Questions:
1. What is the primary source of energy for the water cycle?
2. What happens to water when it evaporates?
3. How do clouds form?
4. Name three types of precipitation.
5. Where does water collect after precipitation?

Think about it: How might climate change affect the water cycle? Consider changes in temperature and weather patterns.
